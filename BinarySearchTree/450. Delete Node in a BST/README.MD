# 450. Delete Node in a BST

üîó Link: [Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description)<br>
üí° Difficulty: Medium<br>
üõ†Ô∏è Topics: Tree, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree<br>

## Question

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

### Example 1

![](example1.png)

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

### Example 2

![](example2.png)

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

### Example 3

Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []

### Constraints

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
* `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
* Each node has a **unique** value.
* `root` is a valid binary search tree.
* `-10^5 <= key <= 10^5`

### Follow-up

Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?

## UMPIRE Method

### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

See xxxx-solution.cpp

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution
