## Question

You have a set which contains all positive integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]`.

Implement the `SmallestInfiniteSet` class:

* `SmallestInfiniteSet()` Initializes the `SmallestInfiniteSet` object to contain all positive integers.
* `int popSmallest()` Removes and returns the smallest integer contained in the infinite set.
* `void addBack(int num)` Adds a positive integer num back into the infinite set, if it is not already in the infinite set.

### Example 1

Input
["SmallestInfiniteSet", "addBack", "popSmallest", "popSmallest", "popSmallest", "addBack", "popSmallest", "popSmallest", "popSmallest"]
[[], [2], [], [], [], [1], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, 1, 2, 3, null, 1, 4, 5]

Explanation
SmallestInfiniteSet smallestInfiniteSet = new SmallestInfiniteSet();
smallestInfiniteSet.addBack(2);    // 2 is already in the set, so no change is made.
smallestInfiniteSet.popSmallest(); // return 1, since 1 is the smallest number, and remove it from the set.
smallestInfiniteSet.popSmallest(); // return 2, and remove it from the set.
smallestInfiniteSet.popSmallest(); // return 3, and remove it from the set.
smallestInfiniteSet.addBack(1);    // 1 is added back to the set.
smallestInfiniteSet.popSmallest(); // return 1, since 1 was added back to the set and
                                   // is the smallest number, and remove it from the set.
smallestInfiniteSet.popSmallest(); // return 4, and remove it from the set.
smallestInfiniteSet.popSmallest(); // return 5, and remove it from the set.

### Constraints

* `1 <= num <= 1000`
* At most 1000 calls will be made in total to popSmallest and addBack.

## UMPIRE Method

### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

Since the range of num is `1 <= num <= 1000`, we can simply maintain a set (which is sorted in C++) and insert 1-1000 in it. Then do the operations using the set

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

See 2336-solution.cpp

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

#### Time Complexity
