## Question

There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` if you can visit all the rooms, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1

Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

### Example 2

Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.

### Constraints

* `n == rooms.length`
* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
* `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
* `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
* All the values of `rooms[i]` are unique.

## UMPIRE Method

### Understand

> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs. 
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.

### Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category

### Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high level implementation with an existing diagram

Start from the first room and add the keys obtained into an `unordered_set`, using BFS to traverse all unvisited rooms.
After all keys are used, check if there are remaining unvisited rooms.

### Implement
> - Implement the solution (make sure to know what level of detail the interviewer wants)

See 841-solution.cpp

### Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

### Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution

#### Time Complexity

`O(N+M)`

#### Space Complexity

`O(N+M)`
